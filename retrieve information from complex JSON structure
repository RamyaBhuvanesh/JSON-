                                    # SDLC METHODOLOGIES:
                                    
# 1. water fall
# 2. agile  --------------> morden one
# 3. spiral
# 4. iterative 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# waterfall methodology:

        # stringent type 
        # traditional model
        # it is the linear sequencial model for SDLC
        # it is divided into phases
        # if you completed first phase yhen you can go to another phase
        # this methodology does not support any changes happenning in between the project
        # if you use this methodolgy you have to deliver it after you complete the whole project to the client
              
              # phases:
                   # 1. analysis
                   # 2. design
                   # 3. execution
                   # 4.testing
                   # 5.deployment
                   
                # advantage: 
                   # its very simple model 
                   # easy to understand
                   # work from one phase to next
                   # developer friendly
                   # no complex is involved
                   
                # dis advantage:
                   # not clear about the project
                   # changes cant be applies
                   # time consuming 
                   # its is not client friendly
                   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                

# agile methodology: (flexible)
 
       # client is also involved and goes on with the project  ------------> (client is also part of the project)
       # iterative process and allows frequent change in the project
       # it is the process of SDLC
       #  rather than requirements this methodology is based on flexibility and adaptability of new changes in the project
       
                  # advantage:
                      # mistakes can be resolved anytime
                      # quick adapatability
                      # client satisficationrisk free
                      # client knows in and out of the project
                      
                  # dis advantage:
                      # lack of documentation
                      # it is not developer friendly
                      # project needs an expert in agile
                      # it is not based on requirement
